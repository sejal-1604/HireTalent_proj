| Firebase Service | Express.js Equivalent |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Firebase Auth | JWT-based authentication |
| Firestore | MongoDB with Mongoose |
| Firebase Storage | Multer + local/cloud storage |
| Firebase Functions | Express.js route handlers |
| Firebase Hosting | Separate frontend deployment |
